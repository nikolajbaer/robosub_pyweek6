DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/

RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Use arrow keys to drive the sub, and hunt for samples. Space bar operates the Claw. Press and hold 'c' and 'h' in game for additional instructions.

KNOWN ISSUES:

Sometimes (ok, often) my crazy Trench generation doesn't make a nice pretty bumpy trench, but instead a weird solid single wall with 'jitters'. It is ugly and not very fun. Restart the game to get a better wall. Slap 'd' to see what I mean.
