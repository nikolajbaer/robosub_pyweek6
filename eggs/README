Drop egg files in here which your game might use.

If you have platform specific eggs, drop them in the 
eggs/<linux2|darwin|win32> folders, and they will be loaded depending on the
platform the code is executed on.

All eggs become available when the game is run using the run_game.py script.
Egg which are not-zip-safe are unpacked automatically the first time they are
used.
